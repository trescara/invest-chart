## Galvanize Investigators: Charting

You're making the new Galvanize website, and need to include a line chart showing how many students have graduated in the last 3 years. You could code the chart from scratch, but this is a problem that's been solved many times by many people, so why not reuse their work? Find and use a charting library to add a chart to the included site. Here's the data:

```
2014: 73
2015: 199
2016: 395
```

Your chart should have labeled axes, no legend, and have an y-axis that starts at 0.

Deploy your work and add a link to it [here]().
